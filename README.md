# Feature Selection Techniques and Handling Missing Values

## Overview
This repository provides an in-depth exploration of feature selection techniques and handling missing values in datasets. Feature selection is a crucial step in machine learning to improve model performance, reduce overfitting, and enhance interpretability. Missing data handling is equally important, as improper treatment of missing values can lead to biased results.

The repository includes code implementations and explanations for various feature selection methods and techniques to handle missing values, making it a valuable resource for data scientists, machine learning practitioners, and researchers.

## Introduction
Feature selection is a process of selecting the most relevant features from a dataset to improve model performance. It helps in:
- Reducing dimensionality
- Improving computational efficiency
- Enhancing model generalization

Handling missing values is equally critical, as missing data can lead to inaccurate models. Various imputation techniques can help manage missing values effectively.

This repository provides Python-based implementations of different feature selection techniques and missing value handling methods.

## Feature Selection Techniques
This section includes various feature selection techniques categorized into:

### 1. **Filter Methods**
Filter methods assess the relevance of features using statistical tests and ranking criteria. Some common techniques include:
- **Variance Thresholding**: Removes features with low variance.
- **Correlation Coefficients**: Removes features highly correlated with others.
- **Chi-Square Test**: Measures dependence between categorical features and the target variable.
- **Mutual Information**: Evaluates the amount of information a feature provides about the target.

### 2. **Wrapper Methods**
Wrapper methods use machine learning models to evaluate feature subsets. Some common techniques include:
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: Iteratively removes the least important features.
- **Forward Feature Selection**: Adds features sequentially based on performance.
- **Backward Feature Elimination**: Starts with all features and removes the least important one by one.

### 3. **Embedded Methods**
Embedded methods integrate feature selection within the model training process. Some widely used techniques include:
- **LASSO Regression (L1 Regularization)**: Shrinks less important features to zero.
- **Decision Tree Feature Importance**: Uses feature importance scores from tree-based models like Random Forest.
- **XGBoost Feature Importance**: Leverages gradient boosting algorithms for feature ranking.

## Handling Missing Values
Handling missing values effectively ensures robust model performance. The repository covers:

### 1. **Removing Missing Values**
- **Complete Case Analysis**: Drops rows with missing values.
- **Removing Columns**: Drops columns with excessive missing values.

### 2. **Imputation Techniques**
- **Mean/Median/Mode Imputation**: Fills missing values using statistical measures.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation**: Estimates missing values using nearest neighbors.
- **Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE)**: Uses regression-based imputation.
- **Deep Learning-based Imputation**: Uses neural networks for missing value estimation.

### 3. **Advanced Methods**
- **Using Machine Learning Models**: Predict missing values based on other features.
- **Data Augmentation Techniques**: Generate synthetic data to fill missing values.

## Results
The repository provides detailed results showing the effectiveness of each method. Key insights include:
- Reduced dataset dimensionality.
- Improved model accuracy after feature selection.
- Effective handling of missing values leading to better predictions.

Sample visualizations and performance metrics are included in the notebooks.
